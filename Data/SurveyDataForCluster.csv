If there was a way to be in a space that made interruptions less frequent (i.e., where you can close a door and not be interrupted), I could do better in the office especially because being in the office makes it easier to take mental breaks and chat with others.  I also find it very valuable to have full computer set up (i.e., a keyboard and two monitors) for my concentration work which often involves multiple spreadsheets or programming.  A workspace that does not have monitors/keyboard available (i.e., you are in a private space but have to work off your laptop) is not very helpful.","It is great to collaborate with people face to face, see their body language and it makes it easier to socialize with each other."

This just never worked as well in a conference room. I also like that everyone is on a level playing field when we're all virtual. In meetings where just one or two are remote and everyone else is in the physical room, the remote folks often got forgotten and left out of the conversation.; Learn: Most of my learning is through webinars, so just easier not to have to worry about wearing headphones so I don't annoy the person next to me.; Restore: Over lunch, I love to go for a walk along the creek near my house and see the ducks and be surrounded by nature. I also like that I can run downstairs and do just a quick 10-minute workout without even having to change clothes, just to get my blood moving a little and give my mind a break. It's just a little quicker and easier at home, and I have more options.",These are probably obvious things. I do think that socializing works better in person when possible. Circulation doesn't really seem like an option when working from home unless I'm misunderstanding the concept.

I answer phones all day. The small talk, laughing, whispering from co workers in the back ground would distract me. I am the main person on the phones from the team so I guess I was more distracted from the background noise/talking. And when it was quite since I am on the phones most of the day I felt like I was talking loud because again I am the main person on the phone. I enjoy working now both at home and primarily at the office myself where it is quite. I prefer the quite atmosphere because I feel like I can think clearer and concentrate.",I would say anything in the office now. With the work change everyone working from home but I am able to come in the office. I work in a quite area. I am not distracted by people talking or people walking back in fourth behind me. I enjoy working in a quite peaceful area.
