In addition, paint the rooms and some purely aesthetic details. We are waiting for those injections to be applied so that the engineer certifies partial use. On the other hand, as for the plot, the weeding of green areas has not been carried out because the municipality of Ponce requires OMEP that we have a container for the deposit of the weed but the school lacks it. OMEP contacted the director to get that container because the one we have is small, but this server does not currently have the resources to get it. Therefore, the school has not done that work.","According to the inspection of the engineer Villegas, the building where the school canteen is located did not have structural failures, you just have to apply injections in some beams.

5. The air conditioning system of the administrative areas is a central one whose chiller has not worked for more than 6 years, the construction of these areas does not provide adequate natural ventilation, which represents a health risk.

In turn fix the ramp that gives access to the court. 4. Installation of bars to rooms that work with innovative curriculum proposal to protect equipment. Also change the existing bars, handrails and gates since they are deteriorated by the elapsed time. 5. Install electric gate to control it from the office and ensure the safety of students, school staff and people who visit us. 6. Installation of doorbell to control group changes on time and not affect school time. To activate them in drills and real emergency cases. 7. Painting for the interior of the living rooms and offices. Remodeling of school court so that it is not outdoors since it gets wet when it rains and can not be used. 8. Place drains from the 3rd level to the 1st level to prevent deterioration of the ceiling, paint and walls. 9. Expand the bathroom of the PK room so that the stretchers can enter and thus cover the need for hygiene.

The type of windows that Science laboratories have (which are dangerous because of the way they open and the space that the window has when opening we can say that a person fits which becomes a risk for students), however ventilation is important.  The school does not have a warehouse to store equipment and materials even though it is a relatively large school. We have requested on other occasions to build one or two warehouses since we have land and spaces to build them.  On the other hand, our school has always been growing, so we need other classrooms to be able to expand our offerings. The number of school employees has increased significantly so we requested to be able to pave an area that is commonly used as a parking lot (green area).  There had been discussion about this matter to pave this area so that we have additional parking for the whole person.

2. Little or no lighting in many areas of the school - Many of the lamps and/or spotlights have been damaged due to water leaks, with Hurricane Maria and there are others that are melted but the AEP does not replace them.
3. Surface of the inner courtyard is inadequate for the type of population we serve. It is a porous surface (compacted gravel) with poor drainage that causes water to become cloudy and creates layers of black fungus. This makes it an extremely slippery surface and has caused many falls among students and school staff. Poor drainage also causes water to get into the basement.
4. It has been about 5 years since the school or the gates were painted.
5. Various problems in the physical plant such as the separation of the wall of the court from the floor by erosion of land in the back, damage caused to the roof of the court by Hurricane Maria that have not been repaired, constant leaks of water by the roofs of almost the entire school, cracks caused by telluric movements,  roof of the entrance of the school with damage since Hurricane Maria, unsquared entrance gates (give problems to open and close), among others.

In the areas of OMEP:
1. Bathroom area to be demolished in front of the school library should be removed. Their floor keeps giving way.
2. Building with problems of short columns waiting to be rehabilitated for use. I have a first degree in a Home Economics classroom.
3. Library roof has more leaks than before. When it rains, water enters the library and the materials are being damaged.
4. Arrangement of the gates that were left to fix them. They were 6 feet and they put them 5 feet.
5. Damaged air consoles and window airs that need to be repaired. 

In the areas of AEP:
1. Problems with the cistern. Bombs damaged long ago. Every time there are pressure problems and the tubes break, the connections of the heaters in the area of the school canteen, bathrooms and sinks of the whole school explode.
2. School paint comes off very easily. It seems that the one that was used is not compatible with the material it was from.
3. Leaks in 4 rooms on a second floor have damaged equipment and materials.
4. Consoles of the administrative area, rooms and hall of the Community damaged.
5. Parking area continues to sink. You have to fill area and compact it. It is before the sewage retention well begins.

Nor roofed areas where they can be free of the sun or rain. The court is not roofed so it is impossible to do activities on it for long periods of time.
2. Parking has areas that need to be improved as they are a danger to students and all school staff. 
3. The windows need to be changed as almost all of them are broken or damaged where the water enters every time it rains, damaging materials and equipment. And although they repaired the roofs there are some deficiencies that must be repaired since water sneaks through some buildings and or walls including some electrical receptacles. This brings moisture and fungus in the salons. 
4. The bathrooms are damaged which are not suitable for use leaving very few available for our campus which is large.

En este orden.","* Our school is located in a rural area, where it rains very often especially during the afternoon. Many of the hallways within the campus have no roof such as the hallways to go to the bathroom, the corridors to enter and exit the school, the ramp to enter the dining room, and the corridor to go to the warehouse. Many times our children and staff get wet if they do not have their umbrella on hand when they have to move side by side.
* It is necessary to build a roof for the court that is located inside the school. In addition to using it for the recreation of our children and the use for the physical education class, having a roof, we can use it as a place of activities where the whole school and parents who, so far, do not have it.
* We also need to repair the floor of the corridors since most of them are cracked, broken or uneven causing trips on the part of our students, school staff or visitors if they do not pertain to this. This has caused some fall accidents of our children. Many of these corridors were cracked or uneven by the tremors that occurred in the south west area. 
* When repairing the floors of the corridors, it is necessary to build an efficient drainage that empties the water sources that are caused by the rain and takes them out of the school campus. At the moment there are areas where the water is soaked when it rains a lot where the water does not have a good drainage and is maintained for a long time, sometimes, disabling the passage. 
* The construction of offices or small rooms for the fulfillment of circular letters, such as the support center for parents, office for the psychologist, office for the nurse, the area for isolation in case of contagious diseases, and a place for breastfeeding, are one of the primary needs that at this time, for not having the facilities available,  it has been uphill for us to comply with these.

Excessive noise, from cars, roadways, ambulances, horns, greatly hinders the teaching-learning process. The smoke from the cars that enters the classrooms affecting students and staff, mainly asthmatic and allergic.  It had been recommended to build an anti-noise wall and / or put air to all the rooms to be able to close the windows. Already the OMEP office, environmental services and office staff of the Secretary, made a noise study and it turned out to be excessive, at the moment waiting for the management. Half of the school without electricity due to failure, Example in a classroom half may have electricity and the other may not. 
2. Insufficient electrical load, Electric charge does not allow the correct use of equipment, air conditioners and others, the system falls off when all are connected.  The constant low and rising electric damages the equipment. 
3. Security, the gates. The location of the school, surrounded by avenue, makes one of care. The gates are broken by people who enter the nights to use the court. 
4. Physical plant. Plague of comején and mice. Leaks in administrative office area, TS, Consjera, faculty room EE and regular archives office and 5 rooms. Finish or complete the construction of multipurpose area/lounge, at this time it is a pigeon habitat. Lounges and bathrooms that need to be repaired. There are two bathrooms that the tiles are falling.  Cracks in the physical plant that were observed after the earthquakes.  Entrance gates of cars and trucks broken or malfunction due to the long time of use. 

5. Pest of pigeons. Place meshes in the multipurpose area and indoor court.
