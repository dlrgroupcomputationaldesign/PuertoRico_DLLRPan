In the areas of OMEP:

2. Building with problems of short columns waiting to be rehabilitated for use. I have a first degree in a Home Economics classroom.
3. Library roof has more leaks than before. When it rains, water enters the library and the materials are being damaged.
4. Arrangement of the gates that were left to fix them. They were 6 feet and they put them 5 feet.
5. Damaged air consoles and window airs that need to be repaired. 

In the areas of AEP:
1. Problems with the cistern. Bombs damaged long ago. Every time there are pressure problems and the tubes break, the connections of the heaters in the area of the school canteen, bathrooms and sinks of the whole school explode.
2. School paint comes off very easily. It seems that the one that was used is not compatible with the material it was from.
3. Leaks in 4 rooms on a second floor have damaged equipment and materials.
4. Consoles of the administrative area, rooms and hall of the Community damaged.

Many of the hallways within the campus have no roof such as the hallways to go to the bathroom, the corridors to enter and exit the school, the ramp to enter the dining room, and the corridor to go to the warehouse. Many times our children and staff get wet if they do not have their umbrella on hand when they have to move side by side.
* It is necessary to build a roof for the court that is located inside the school. In addition to using it for the recreation of our children and the use for the physical education class, having a roof, we can use it as a place of activities where the whole school and parents who, so far, do not have it.
* We also need to repair the floor of the corridors since most of them are cracked, broken or uneven causing trips on the part of our students, school staff or visitors if they do not pertain to this. This has caused some fall accidents of our children. Many of these corridors were cracked or uneven by the tremors that occurred in the south west area. 
* When repairing the floors of the corridors, it is necessary to build an efficient drainage that empties the water sources that are caused by the rain and takes them out of the school campus. At the moment there are areas where the water is soaked when it rains a lot where the water does not have a good drainage and is maintained for a long time, sometimes, disabling the passage. 
* The construction of offices or small rooms for the fulfillment of circular letters, such as the support center for parents, office for the psychologist, office for the nurse, the area for isolation in case of contagious diseases, and a place for breastfeeding, are one of the primary needs that at this time, for not having the facilities available,  it has been uphill for us to comply with these.
