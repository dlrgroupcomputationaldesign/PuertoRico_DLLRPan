Due to studies the school must go in exchange for order. The inspection posted on the Department's website says the school may operate partially. In this regard he made the request that they go and inspect. The school was visited by the engineer Villegas who made an inspection of the campus and determined that the school can be used partially with the application of between 6 and 8 injections in beams and a column. In addition, paint the rooms and some purely aesthetic details. We are waiting for those injections to be applied so that the engineer certifies partial use. On the other hand, as for the plot, the weeding of green areas has not been carried out because the municipality of Ponce requires OMEP that we have a container for the deposit of the weed but the school lacks it. OMEP contacted the director to get that container because the one we have is small, but this server does not currently have the resources to get it. Therefore, the school has not done that work.","According to the inspection of the engineer Villegas, the building where the school canteen is located did not have structural failures, you just have to apply injections in some beams. The building where the office of the Director and Library is in addition to 5 rooms can also operate. The building behind the office and two adjoining rooms are in considerable condition if the aforementioned is done. In addition, the School Court is also in considerable condition.

The five concerns are as follows: 1 Replacement of pipes from all bathrooms so that they can properly de-discharge and avoid sewage. 2. Change of windows, doors and door locks in the form of a lever to minimize architectural barriers3. Construction of ramp in building that provides access to the 3rd level and comply with Law 238. In turn fix the ramp that gives access to the court. 4. Installation of bars to rooms that work with innovative curriculum proposal to protect equipment. Also change the existing bars, handrails and gates since they are deteriorated by the elapsed time. 5. Install electric gate to control it from the office and ensure the safety of students, school staff and people who visit us. 6. Installation of doorbell to control group changes on time and not affect school time. To activate them in drills and real emergency cases. 7. Painting for the interior of the living rooms and offices. Remodeling of school court so that it is not outdoors since it gets wet when it rains and can not be used. 8. Place drains from the 3rd level to the 1st level to prevent deterioration of the ceiling, paint and walls. 9. Expand the bathroom of the PK room so that the stretchers can enter and thus cover the need for hygiene.
